      <article>
        I am a Senior Assessment Developer at Workera. I earned my bachelorâ€™s in
        Computer Science and Engineering from the Chittagong University of
        Engineering and Technology (CUET), Bangladesh. I am extremely fortunate
        to be advised by Dr. Mohammed Moshiul Hoque. I am a recipient of Fatima
        Al-Fihri Predoctoral Fellowship where I am collaborating with UC Santa
        Barbara Natural Language Processing Group on multilingual conceptual
        coverage in text-to-image models. I am a former Undergraduate Research
        Student at CUET NLP lab, where I had the chance to work with on
        developing benchmark corpus and frameworks for Bangla Natural Language
        Processing. I am a professional member of IEEE and the former Vice
        Chairman of IEEE CUET Women In Engineering Affinity Group. My research
        interest navigates the broad intersection of Machine Learning and
        Natural Language Processing. My interest lies in knowledge
        representation and commonsense reasoning, especially within multilingual
        and multimodal contexts (encompassing vision, language, and acoustics).
        A significant focus of my work is unraveling the nuances of semantics,
        understanding how meaning is constructed and interpreted across
        different languages and modalities. I am deeply invested in pushing the
        boundaries of natural language understanding and generation, focusing on
        creating models that are not only advanced but also fair, robust, and
        explainable. Beyond this, my passion extends to the fusion of Computer
        Vision, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and NLP. Here, my goal is to
        transcend traditional interfaces, fostering a new era of societal
        communication that bridges gaps between diverse communities. This also
        involves deepening our collective understanding of cognitive processes
        through AI, unraveling how machines can emulate, complement, and enhance
        human thought and interaction.
